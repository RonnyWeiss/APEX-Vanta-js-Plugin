# APEX-Vanta-js-Plugin

![Screenshot](https://github.com/RonnyWeiss/APEX-Vanta-js-Plugin/blob/master/screenshot.gif?raw=true)

This Plug-in brings Vanta.js animations easy to your APEX app. WebGL makes the animations much prettier and more CPU efficient than CSS or SVG animations. E.g. Pimp your login screen with a very nice sky flight.


Examples can be found in the Sample App:

The Code is also running without APEX. For test just start index.html!
